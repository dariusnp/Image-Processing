The new value of any pixel from the output image is obtained by combining the values of the pixels from the initial image, placed around the processed pixel (in the neighbourhood of the processed pixel). The origin of the filterring window is moved from pixel to pixel within the image until all the pixels are processed. The transform T is a function that combines the values extracted from the input image. <b>T</b> is applied at each location <b>(l, c)</b> in order to obtain the result <b>g (l, c)</b>, in that particular location. <b>Figure 1</b> shows an example for a 3x3 neighbourhood.</p>\n",
