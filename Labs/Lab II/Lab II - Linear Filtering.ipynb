    "During previous lectures, you learned about improving images by modifying each pixel individually (without taking into account where it is positioned). Neighbourhood operation take into account the values surrounding our pixel of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f(l,c)$ be the initial input image, $g(l,c)$ be the processed output image and $T$ be an operator on $f$, defined over some neighborhood of pixel $(l,c)$. The new value of any pixel within the processed image is obtained by combining  some pixel values from the initial image, placed around (in the neighborhood of) the current processed pixel. The center of the neighborhood is moved from pixel to pixel spanning the whole image. The operator $T$ is a function that combines the values extracted from the image. $T$ is applied at each location $(l,c)$ to yield the output, $g(l,c)$, at that location. The process utilizes only the pixels in the area of the image spanned by the neighborhood.\n",

    "In order to define the transform, the <b>shape of the neighbourhood</b> of the current processed pixel $V_{(l,c)}$ and the <b>operator $T$</b> need to be defined.\n",

    "Defining the neighborhood means specifying the locations of pixels belonging to that neighborhood, with respect to the current location, i.e. the current processed pixel located at $(l,c)$. The neighborhood $V_{(l,c)}$ is:\n",
    "$$V_{(l,c)} = \\{(m_1,n_1),(m_2,n_2),...,(m_k,n_k)\\}$$\n",
    "where $(m_i,n_i)$ are the relative coordinates with respect to the current pixel $(l,c)$. The current processed location $(l,c)$ is the origin of the coordinate system attached to the neighborhood.\n",

    "## 2. Linear filtering of images\n",
    "If $T$ is a linear function, then the transform is called <b>linear filtering</b> and is written as:\n",
    "$$g(l,c) = \\sum_{(m,n)\\epsilon V}w_{mn}f(m+l,n+c)$$\n",
    "where $w_{mn}$ are scalar constants called the <b>coefficients (or weights)</b> of the filter.\n",

    "<b>Taking this into account, linear filtering is actually a weighted sum of the pixels found in the neighbourhood of the current pixel.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the chosen weights, the result of the filter will differ. To simplify things, when defining a linear filter, we will use a matrix (called the <b>mask</b>) of the form of the neighbourhood that contains the coefficients of the filter. <img src=\"mask.png\"><center>The mask of a 3x3 neighbourhood filter</center>"
